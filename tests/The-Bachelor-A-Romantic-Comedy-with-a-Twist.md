The Bachelor is not a masterpiece, but it may entertain you for an hour and a half. It is a movie that does not take itself too seriously and has some funny moments. If you like romantic comedies with a twist, you may want to give it a try.
  
The movie has some interesting trivia behind it. For example, several of the brides chasing Jimmie at the end of the movie are male extras in drag[^1^]. The movie is also based on a silent movie by Buster Keaton called Seven Chances, which was filmed in some of the same locations in San Francisco[^1^]. The movie also features a reference to Brooke Shields, who plays one of Jimmie's ex-girlfriends, when another bride says she went to Princeton where Brooke Shields went[^1^].
 
The movie also has some notable cast members, such as Mariah Carey, who made her acting debut in this movie as one of Jimmie's ex-girlfriends[^2^]. The movie also includes two Oscar winners: RenÃ©e Zellweger and Peter Ustinov; and two Oscar nominees: James Cromwell and Hal Holbrook[^1^]. The movie was directed by Gary Sinyor, who also directed The Bachelor (2003), a reality TV show based on the same premise as the movie[^2^].
 
The movie was not a critical success, as it received mostly negative reviews from critics. It has a 31% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 70 reviews, with an average score of 4.4/10[^2^]. The critics criticized the movie for being predictable, unfunny, and sexist. However, some viewers may find the movie amusing and charming, as it does not pretend to be anything more than a silly romantic comedy. The movie also has some memorable scenes, such as the chase sequence with hundreds of brides running after Jimmie.
  
The movie was also a modest success at the box office, as it grossed $36.9 million worldwide against its $21 million budget[^3^]. The movie opened at number 3 at the North American box office behind The Bone Collector and House on Haunted Hill, making $7.5 million in its opening weekend. The movie was distributed by New Line Cinema, which also produced other romantic comedies such as The Wedding Singer and The Notebook[^3^].
 
The movie has a cult following among some fans of romantic comedies, who appreciate its quirky humor and sweet romance. The movie also has some memorable quotes, such as when the priest says to Jimmie: "It's a wonderful thing, as time goes by, to be with someone who looks into your face, when you've gotten old, and still sees what you think you look like" [^2^]. The movie also has a catchy soundtrack, featuring songs by David Byrne, Elvis Costello, and Mariah Carey [^2^].
 
The Bachelor is a movie that may not appeal to everyone, but it may surprise some viewers with its charm and fun. It is a movie that celebrates love and marriage, even if it does so in a ridiculous and unrealistic way. It is a movie that shows that sometimes, you have to take a chance and follow your heart.
